    <p>Delicious coating on outside of roast, and perfect roasting time. Plan on 1 pound per person.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 pound) boneless prime rib roast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 small unpeeled onion, quartered and separated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons concentrated beef base (paste)</li>
        <li>1Â½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The day before serving, remove the roast from the package, and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Set the roast on a baking sheet, and place in refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking time to allow meat to reach room temperature. Rub the roast all over with horseradish and Dijon mustard. In a bowl, mix together the kosher salt, black pepper, thyme, and garlic powder; sprinkle the spice mix over the roast.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the celery, carrot, and onion pieces into the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the roast on top of the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and roast until the meat is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from oven, transfer roast to a platter, and cover with a tent of aluminum foil. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. Temperature of the meat will rise about 10 degrees during resting time.</li>
        <li>To make au jus sauce, skim excess fat from the pan drippings in the roasting pan. Place the pan over a burner set to medium heat, and stir in the beef base and 1 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, scraping and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the pan. Strain out and discard the vegetables. Combine the cornstarch and 1 teaspoon of water in a small bowl, and whisk the mixture into the sauce. Allow the sauce to thicken slightly (sauce will be thin), pour into a gravy boat, and serve with roast.</li>
